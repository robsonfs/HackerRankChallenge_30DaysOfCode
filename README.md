# HackerRank Challenge - 30 Days Of Code

30 Days of Code is an opportunity for you to learn how to code or brush up on your fundamentals. Each day, you'll unlock a new challenge and a corresponding video tutorial to help you learn.

I'm using this repo to store my solutions, written in python, for this challenge.
